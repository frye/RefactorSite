# Horiseon home page refactoring

## Description
I was tasked to refactor the Horiseon inc web page. Keeping in mind accessibility and search engine optimization. This repository contains the changes since the initial version that I was provided with.

## The Assignment
The assigment was in a form of user story and acceptance criteria.

### User Story
```AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Screenshots
I am providing two screenshots here for reference. The first one shows the header, including navigation as well as the hero image. The second one shows a section of the primary content in the wep page.
